    // 1. Macros
    // 1.1 Macros are a way to generate code using metaprogramming
    // 1.2 Macros are invoked using the ! operator
    // 1.3 Macros can take a variable number of arguments
    // 1.4 Macros can be overloaded
    // 1.5 Macros can be used to define new syntax
    // 1.6 Macros can be used to reduce boilerplate code
    // 1.7 Macros can be used to generate tests
    // 1.8 Macros can be used to generate code at compile time
    // 1.9 Macros can be used to generate code at runtime
    // 1.10 Macros can be used to generate code for different platforms
    // 1.11 There are two types of macros: declarative macros and procedural macros
    // 1.12 Declarative macros are also known as macros by example
    // 1.13 Procedural macros are also known as custom derive macros
    // 1.14 Macros can be used to generate code for different architectures
